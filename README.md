# Production

# First-.NET-Experience
A little mockup of the NWU website after learning asp.net for the first time.

# Problem my code solves
The problem this code aimed to solve was to enable students to make bookings on a specific day for a coding workshop.
They would have to register if they have not yet done so, otherwise they can log in and make their booking.

# Problem solving approach
The approach was first to enable the user to register so that they can use the system.  When they registered, their details
are stored in a database.  This enables them to login seamlessly when they need to use the service again.  When they come to the process 
of making a booking, I had to display to them whether or not they have already made a booking and if they did what the details were.  They can then also 
choose the date t make a new booking.

# Moral 
As this has been my first experience learning asp.net, the challenge for me was understanding the sessions.  How when and where
to store them.  This had a immense impact on my software development journey to date as it opened my eyes as to how much work goes into
the services we use daily.
